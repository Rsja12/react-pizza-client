**React Pizza**
---------
React Pizza is a simple e-commerce web application where users can choose pizzas from a menu and/or create their own, and afterwards add them to a shopping cart. The shopping cart component allows the user to edit the cart and see the pricing update in real time.

**Motivation**
---------
This is the first application I built using React and Redux, and the main purpose of building this application was simply to understand these tools a little better.

**Tech Used**
---------
React | Redux | Thunk | Semantic UI
